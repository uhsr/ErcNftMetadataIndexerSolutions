# ErcNftMetadataIndexerSolutions

## Description



## Features

- Utilizes a distributed cache with Redis to minimize database read latency for frequently accessed NFT metadata.
- Employs a message queue (e.g., Kafka) to asynchronously process NFT transfer events and prevent bottlenecks during peak transaction periods.
- Implements a GraphQL API endpoint for efficient and flexible querying of NFT metadata and ownership information.
- Stores indexed NFT metadata in a document-oriented database (e.g., MongoDB) to accommodate varying schema structures and evolving metadata standards.
- Integrates with IPFS gateways to retrieve and cache NFT media assets, improving content delivery speed.
- Dynamically adjusts indexing concurrency based on network congestion and system resource utilization to optimize indexing performance.
- Provides a configurable retry mechanism with exponential backoff for handling temporary RPC endpoint failures during event processing.
- Generates detailed logging and metrics using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring indexer health and performance.
